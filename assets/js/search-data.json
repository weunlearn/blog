            "content": "Wulu Data Analysis . The following post contains the data analysis of the attitude changes the we percieved in our project for the Stanford Longevity design challenge. For a more detailed report on how the project planned, executed and what we learned from it, we will be updating the post with a relevant report soon. . Analysis . Comparison between baseline and endline questionnaire scores using only the best option as the answer . The following chart establishes a relationship between age and score, with gender taken as a differentiating parameter. With an increase in age, there appears to be a more susceptibility to a positive change in attitude. It is also evident that this change is reflected more in the girls. . Trends with respect to parents education levels . Based on . Gender | Age | Education | Count of children | . Effects of parent&#39;s education on mean scores of the questionnaires. . Adolescents whose mothers have had education above high school showed a 85.71% change in their total scores between baseline and endline while adolescents whose mothers did not have beyond high school education showed 69% change. | . Adolescents whose fathers have had education above high school showed a 32.81% change in their total scores between baseline and endline while adolescents whose fathers did not have beyond high school education showed 79.24% change. | . The strong correlation that completing secondary education shows with delaying age of marriage and pregnancy in girls (United Nations) suggests that education also leads to developing more gender equitable attitudes. Hence, it could be explained that educated mothers have more gender equitable attitudes and Intergenerational Transmission of gender attitudes (Moen et al, 1997) results in their daughters having more equitable attitudes as well. . Conclusion . Demographic . In general more than half the participants across both groups had parents with education levels less than high school. Attitude change observed in adolescents varied with the education level of their mothers but not their fathers. A greater change was observed in adolescents whose mothers have had higher education (high school and above). The change in attitude was higher in girls than boys for all questions, especially on questions regarding male involvement at household level. . Gender stereotypes on education . There was a positive shift in attitude regarding the importance of girl education and the stereotypes attached with educated women. This change was observed irrespective of the gender of the participant. . Gender roles at home . While there was a significant positive change in the traditional view of a man being head of family, the attitudes regarding boys doing household chores or women moving beyond caregiving roles did not see much positive change. . Bullying and body shaming . There was a positive change regarding change in attitude to deal with bullying and body shaming. While the incremental change was highest in bullying, most adolescents across treatment and control had a positive attitude towards dealing with body shaming as well. Gender stereotypes regarding appearance did not show much positive change .",
