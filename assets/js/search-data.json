When we choose projects to work on, we ensure that they will play a role in uplifting the human race as a whole. . This team spirit also translates in the way we work within the organisation. We ensure team members have the space to express themselves and exist just as they are, which enables them to lend their own unique voice to our work. Our team feeds off of each other’s ideas and inspires each other’s creativity . . We always strive for efficiency over long work hours and place our team’s mental health needs as the top priority. Our “Buddy System” enables members to take time-off when required without hindering productivity of the team as a whole. . At this moment, we are only beginning, but we wish to ensure the principles we hold close to our hearts as individuals are transferred to our work culture. Our goal? If there could be a Disneyland (happiest place on Earth!) for offices, we would be it! .",
